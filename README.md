# Nursi-Hackathon-Project
 NURSI is a smart infant crib that integrates technology with childcare to enhance infant safety and provide parents and caregivers with reliable monitoring of the child’s condition and surrounding environment

## Project Overview
Nursi is a smart crib system designed to enhance infant safety and provide peace of mind for parents by integrating smart electronics, sensors, and data-driven monitoring.  
The project addresses common challenges faced by parents, such as monitoring a baby’s condition, ensuring safe sleeping positions, and reducing sleep disruption caused by constant manual check-ups.

This project was developed collaboratively as part of a hackathon and successfully delivered within a limited time frame.
